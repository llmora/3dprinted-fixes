Various 3D printed replacement pieces for broken things
=======================================================

Over the years things break, most of the time it is just a small secondary piece
that should be easy to replace, however it is most of the times difficult, if
not downright impossible, to source these components - vendors are happy
to sell you the next model instead of spares, much bigger margins for them.

This is a collection of 3D-printable replacement spares that we have designed to
replace some of those hard-to-find components, I hope these are as useful to you
as they have been for us.
